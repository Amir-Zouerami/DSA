## Bitmask Solution
`IsValidSudokuBitMasking` uses bitmasks.

first we initialize:

```go
rows := make([]int, 9)      // 9 integers, one for each row
cols := make([]int, 9)      // 9 integers, one for each column
squares := make([]int, 9)   // 9 integers, one for each 3×3 square

```

Then we extract the number and set its bit:

```go
val := cell - '1'
bit := 1 << val
squareIdx := (r/3)*3 + c/3
```

`cell` is a byte so it is just the UTF-8 value. `'1'` is ASCII 49. On the other hand we already know we have 9 rows and columns.
So we can easily convert `'1'` to 0, `'2'` to 1, ..., `'9'` to 8, so it can be used as a bit index.

`1 << val` is shifting the bits by `value`:

`1 << 0` = `000000001` (binary) → represents 1
`1 << 1` = `000000010` (binary) → represents 2
`1 << 2` = `000000100` (binary) → represents 3
`1 << 8` = `100000000` (binary) → represents 9

This allows us to track numbers using bitwise flags.
