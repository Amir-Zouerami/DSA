This one was a bitch to get right.

ASCII values for English characters are like this:

```
'a' = 97
'b' = 98
'c' = 99
...
'z' = 122
```

The question says the strings only include lowercase English letters. If we choose 'a':

```
'a' - 'a' = 97 - 97 = 0  // First index in the array
'b' - 'a' = 98 - 97 = 1
'c' - 'a' = 99 - 97 = 2
'z' - 'a' = 122 - 97 = 25 // Last index in the array
```

This normalizes the index within the range `[0, 25]` which is perfect for a `var m [26]int`.

Using other characters like 'z' would cause out-of-bounds error:

```go
'a' - 'z' = 97 - 122 = -25 (Out of bounds, causes panic!)
```

Same with 'A':

```go
'a' - 'A' = 97 - 65 = 32 (Out of bounds!)
```

## Runes vs Strings

keep in mind that strings are sequences of bytes so:

```go
fmt.Println("hello"[1]) // Output: 101 (ASCII value of 'e')
```

Also:

```go
r := 'A'
fmt.Println(r) // Output: 65 (ASCII value of 'A')
```

Basically:

```go
    fmt.Println("Golang"[0] == 'G') // true (71 == 71)
```
