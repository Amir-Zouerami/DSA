## How?

We are using a **difference-based encoding** to save memory.

Instead of keeping an extra stack for the minimums, we stores the difference between the pushed value and the current min.

The general procedure is:

- Instead of pushing the actual value, it pushes` x - min` (the difference).
- If `x` is smaller than min, it updates min and stores a negative difference.
- On `Pop()`, if the popped value was negative, it means min was updated, so it restores the previous `min`.
